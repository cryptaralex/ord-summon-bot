## Usage
The website will be up @ http://localhost:443 (unless you've changed the config)

Files uploaded on the site will be available in the channel that you set in `Global.js`

## Usage with ShareX
CDN Slave can also be used with [ShareX](https://getsharex.com/)! Follow these steps to get it working (don't want to follow steps? [click here to download the config](https://cdn.spin.rip/r/CDN-Slave_(Discord_CDN).sxcu)):

1. Copy the upload endpoint. If using localhost it will be `http://localhost:443/api/upload`, or if you're using my instance it will be `https://cdn-slave.spin.rip/api/upload`
2. Open ShareX and go to `Destinations` > `Custom uploader settings` > Click `New`
3. Name it whatever you want & paste the upload endpoint in `Request URL`
4. Under `Destination type`, select `Image uploader`, `Text uploader`, and `File uploader`
5. Body should be `Form data (multipart/form-data)` and `File form name` should just be `file`.
6. In the headers section, set the name to `Upload-Source` and the value to `API`
7. Select your new ShareX config in the dropdowns at the bottom left of your screen
8. Have fun with your new CDN slave.
